Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to build, package, and run applications in lightweight, portable containers.

Here’s a simple breakdown 👇

🧱 1. What Docker Does

Docker helps you create containers, which are isolated environments that package:

Your application code

Its dependencies (libraries, tools, configuration files)

And the runtime environment

This ensures the app runs the same on any system — whether it's your laptop, a server, or the cloud.

⚙️ 2. Why Containers Are Useful

Before Docker, developers used virtual machines (VMs), which are heavier and slower.
Containers are:

🪶 Lightweight — they share the host OS kernel instead of running a full OS per app

⚡ Fast — they start almost instantly

🔁 Consistent — “it works on my machine” problems disappear

🚀 Portable — run anywhere (Windows, Linux, macOS, cloud)

📦 3. Core Docker Concepts
Term	Meaning
Image	A blueprint of the application (like a snapshot).
Container	A running instance of an image.
Dockerfile	A text file with instructions to build an image.
Docker Hub	A public repository to share and download Docker images.
💡 4. Example

Let’s say you have a Java web app.
Instead of setting up Java and dependencies manually on every system, you can create a Dockerfile like this:

FROM openjdk:17
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
CMD ["java", "-jar", "myapp.jar"]


Then you can run:

docker build -t myapp .
docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp


And your app runs the same way everywhere!

🌍 5. Common Uses

Running microservices

Simplifying deployment (CI/CD)

Testing in consistent environments

Isolating applications on a single host
